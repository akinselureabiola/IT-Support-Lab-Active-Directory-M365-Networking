## Scenario

In this lab, I worked on preparing a Linux server for integration into an existing Active Directory environment.

In many real-world setups, Linux servers need to authenticate against Active Directory for centralized user management.

My goal here was to make sure the Linux server could properly communicate with the Domain Controller by validating network connectivity, DNS configuration, and domain discovery.

This is a critical step before attempting a domain join, as most integration failures are caused by DNS or connectivity issues.

The output confirms that the Linux server has been assigned the correct IP address within the 192.168.10.0/24 enterprise network.

---

# DNS Configuration

Active Directory environments rely heavily on DNS for service discovery.

The Linux server was configured to use the Domain Controller as its DNS server.

Verification command:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

![Linux DNS Configuration](./screenshots/linux-resolv-conf.png)

This screenshot shows the DNS configuration file verified using the command above.

It confirms that the Linux server is configured to use 192.168.10.10 as its primary DNS server, allowing it to resolve Active Directory resources.

---

# Connectivity Validation

Connectivity between the Linux server and Domain Controller was tested using ICMP.

Command executed:

```bash
ping -c 4 192.168.10.10
```
![Linux and Domain Controller Connectivity](./screenshots/linux-ping-dc.png)

The screenshot displays the result of the connectivity test.

Successful replies confirm:

The Linux server can reach the Domain Controller

Internal lab network communication is functioning correctly

The infrastructure is ready for Active Directory integration

---

# DNS Resolution

The successful hostname resolution confirms that the Linux server can resolve Active Directory DNS records and communicate with the domain environment.

Command executed:

```bash
ping -c 4 dc01.bpurple.com
```


![Linux Domain Resolution](./screenshots/linux-domain-resolution.png)

The successful hostname resolution confirms:

The Linux server can resolve Active Directory DNS records

The Domain Controller is discoverable through DNS

The system is ready for Kerberos-based authentication



# Virtual Machine Network Configuration

The Linux virtual machine network adapter was configured in Oracle VirtualBox.

Network settings:

Adapter 1 → Internal Network
Network Name → LABNET

![VirtualBox Network Settings](./screenshots/virtualbox-network-settings.png)

The screenshot above shows the **Oracle VirtualBox network adapter configuration**.

The Linux virtual machine is connected to the **LABNET internal network**

This configuration allows communication between:

- Domain Controller (DC01)
- Windows Client (CLIENT01)
- Linux Server (LINUX-SRV01)

within the isolated lab environment.

---

# Domain Integration Preparation

The Linux system was prepared for Active Directory integration by installing the required authentication and identity services packages.

Packages installed:

- realmd
- sssd
- krb5-user
- adcli
- samba-common-bin
- oddjob
- oddjob-mkhomedir

These components enable Linux systems to integrate with Active Directory using **Kerberos authentication and SSSD identity services**.

The installation was completed using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install realmd sssd krb5-user adcli samba-common-bin oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir
```

---

## Active Directory Discovery

Before joining the domain, the Linux server must confirm it can discover the Active Directory environment.

Command executed:

```bash
realm discover bpurple.com
```

Expected output confirms:

- Active Directory domain detected
- Kerberos realm discovered
- Domain join configuration available

Successful discovery verifies that the Linux server can communicate with Active Directory services and is ready for domain authentication configuration.

---

# Domain Join

Once the Linux server successfully discovers the Active Directory domain, the next step is joining the system to the domain.

Command used for domain join:

```bash
sudo realm join bpurple.com
```

During the join process, the system requests credentials from a domain administrator with permission to add computers to the domain.

Successful domain integration enables:

* Active Directory authentication for Linux logins
* Centralized identity management
* Kerberos-based authentication
* SSSD-based user identity services

This lab focused on validating the infrastructure prerequisites required before performing a domain join operation.

---

# Troubleshooting Notes

During validation, the following checks were performed:

| Check | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `ip a` | Verify network interface configuration |
| `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | Validate DNS configuration |
| `ping 192.168.10.10` | Confirm network connectivity |
| `ping dc01.bpurple.com` | Confirm domain name resolution |


All checks returned successful results, indicating that the Linux server was correctly configured to communicate with the Active Directory environment.

# Business Impact

In real enterprise environments, Linux servers are often required to integrate with Active Directory for centralized authentication.

If DNS or connectivity is not properly configured, domain join operations will fail, leading to delays in system deployment and increased troubleshooting time.

Ensuring these prerequisites are correctly set up helps prevent authentication issues and reduces onboarding time for new systems.

# Key Takeaway

This lab showed me how critical DNS and network configuration are when integrating Linux systems with Active Directory.

Before attempting a domain join, it’s important to verify connectivity, DNS resolution, and domain discovery.

In many cases, integration issues are not caused by the domain itself, but by missing prerequisites on the Linux system.

---

# Conclusion

In this lab, I successfully prepared a Linux server for integration into an Active Directory environment.

I was able to validate network connectivity, configure DNS correctly, and confirm that the server could discover and communicate with the domain controller.

With these prerequisites in place, the system is now ready for domain join and centralized authentication using Kerberos and SSSD.

This setup reflects the real-world process of preparing Linux systems for enterprise identity integration.
